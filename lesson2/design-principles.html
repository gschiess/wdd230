        <h3>PARC - Contrast</h3>

        <p>
          The xyproblem website is a great example when talking about the C in
          the PARC design principles. Although it is a very simple website I
          believe that helps when explaining how to use contrast to your
          benefit. The majority of the website is black text on a white
          background which helps for reading, but there are also spots where
          they use black on gray which helps grab your attention.

        <h3>PARC - Repetition</h3>

        <p>
          The BYU-Idaho instructure website (on the card view), show a great
          example of the Repetition principle with how they repeat the cards
          used for the different classes. It helps keep the entire website
          organized, and showcase the different classes you have without
          thinking needed.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <strong>Monkeytype</strong>
        <p><a href="https://monkeytype.com/">https://monkeytype.com/</a></p>
        <img
          src="/lesson2/images/monkeytype.com.png"
          alt="Screenshot of website being used as example for white space and clean design principle"
        />
        <p>
          The monkeytype website is a good place to showcase whitespace and
          clean design. There is a good amount of stuff going on on this page
          but when you take a closer look its has a good design and has a good
          amount of padding in the certain areas where it needs its, such as all
          the social links in the footer. Also the white space in-between each
          seperate section gives it a clean design which makes it not look
          cluttered with the amount of stuff on the page.
